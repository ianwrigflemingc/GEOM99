<h1 class="highlight">DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h1>

<h3>
  Successfully arriving at a desired destination takes proper planning, communication, and execution of a well laid out plan. 
  Prior to any forward progress, a clear vision of the path to tread needs to be formed. As a group, we set out to map and create our vision. 
  The journey to our destination is outlined below. 
</h3>

<div class="containerleft">
  <h1>Deciding on a Topic</h1>
  <img class="left" src="images\FlemingandCRIBE.jfif" alt="Topic">
  <p>Our assignment to build an application using technologies of our choice presented the perfect opportunity to lay the 
    groundwork and gain experience for the future design and completion of our collaborative project.</p>
  <p>Based on the needs previously established with the Centre for Research and Innovation in the Bio-Economy (CRIBE), 
    our team decided to refine the scope of the collaborative project down to a manageable size. The refining process took 
    a few attempts as we considered the different useful forestry applications such as, routing, least cost path analysis, 
    facility locations, biomass availability and Ontario forest management unit (FMU) boundaries.</p>
  <p>In the end, our group decided to focus on creating a forestry infographic designed to present the end user with 
    beneficial information about forestry facility locations found throughout Ontario accompanied by the Ontario FMU 
    boundaries and its corresponding wood biomass information.</p>
</div>

<div class="containerleft">
  <h1>Deciding on a Platform</h1>
    <img class="right" src="images\platform.png" alt="platform">
    <p>Our group predetermined that CRIBE uses the ESRI suite of products to run their geographic website components. 
      The choice between which platform to pick was quickly narrowed down to Dashboards, AppBuilder and Experience Builder.</p> 
    <p>At first our group considered using Dashboards because CRIBE currently uses this application on their website. It is 
      well suited for displaying location-based statistics on a dashboard style layout. Dashboards was quickly weeded out 
      because we didn’t intend to incorporate statistics into our application.</p>
    <p>AppBuilder became our next focus. It boasts 70 plus widgets that provided us with a wide array of functionality to 
      choose from whereas Experience Builder had only 18 to pick from. Our concern with AppBuilder was it is older 
      technology and only provided a mapcentric, fixed screen option.</p>
    <p>Our group then turned to Experience Builder to compare the two applications. Experience Builder is new and provides 
      options like a scrolling screen, single or multiple page options and is built of ArcGIS API 4.x for Javascript.</p>
    <h3>After considering the pros and cons of each, we decided to move forward with Experience Builder based on the fact 
      it is newer technology. </h3>

  <h1>Finding and Processing the Data</h1>
  <img class="left" src="images\OntarioGeohub.JPG" alt="Geohub logo">
  <p>After deciding on Experience Builder as our platform, we had to find and process the data using 
    ArcPro. Ontario GeoHub and Data Catalogue had the data we needed, consisting of (links provided):</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/forest-management-unit?geometry=-151.490%2C38.917%2C-17.984%2C58.786" target="_blank">Forest Management Units (Shapefile)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/available-wood-report" target="_blank">Ontario Wood Report (Excel file)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/forest-processing-facility?geometry=-151.490%2C38.917%2C-17.984%2C58.786"target="_blank">Forest Processing Facilities (Shapefile)</a></li>
    </ol>
  
  <img class="left" src="images\FindingData_Excel.png" alt="Finding Available Wood Report">
  <p>Luckily the Processing Facility shapefile was ready to add to our AGOL group content as a Feature Layer. 
    However, the other two layers required processing in ArcPro first.</p>
  <p>The first step was to reformat the Available Wood report. This consisted of copying and pasting the rows 
    and columns that we needed into a new excel sheet. Because the end goal was to export the excel file as a .CSV, 
  the column headers also had to distinguish which species were merchantable vs unmerchantable.</p>
  
  <img class="left" src="images\FindingData_ArcPro.png" alt="ArcPro processing">
  <p>Once the .CSV file was ready, we were able to bring it into an ArcPro workspace along with the Forest Management 
    Units layer. The following were the steps taken in ArcPro:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Join Data:</b> Right click on the feature layer > Joins and Relates > Add Join. Once the geoprocessing tool opens: FMU layer as the Layer Name, FMU_Name as Input Joing Field, Wood Report 
        as Join Table, and Forest Unit Name(In our case) as the matching Output Join Field</li>
      <li><b>Make Feature Layer:</b> Because we wanted the convenience of having all the data in one feature class 
        to query in Experience Builder, the joined data (temporary file) was made into a permanent feature class. 
        First in the geoprocessing tools, click on 'Make Feature Layer' tool. Then enter the FMU layer as input 
        features, and the output layer will generate automatically. This tool only creates a temporary (intermediate) file. 
        This tool also allows you to decide which fields you want to carry forward, or whether you want to nix them. </li>
      <li><b>Feature Class to Feature Class:</b> Next step is to export the temporary layer created in the previous step 
        as a feature class to make it permanent using the 'Feature Class to Feature Class tool'.</li>
      <li><b>Share as a Web Layer:</b> The last step was to get the new merge feature class onto the AGOL group account. 
        There are two options:</li>
        <ul class="basic">
          <li>We could have logged on to ArcGIS Online and added the layer on the 'My Content' web page through and then 
            Add Item > From your computer, and finally shared to the group, or;</li>
          <li>Simply <b>Share as a Web Layer</b> under 'Share'. This allows you to not only upload the layer to your 
            own content, but also directly to the group folder. Much easier!</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
</div>


<div class="containerleft">
  <h1>Building a Web Map</h1>
  <img class="right" src="images\CL_MapViewerBeta_Popup.png" alt="Screenshot of Map Viewer Beta">
  <p>The map displayed in the final solution was configured using AGOL Map Viewer (beta). The following steps were followed to 
    cartographically render the forest resources information.</p>
  <p>The screen capture on the right depicts the Map Viewer Beta environment and the configuration of pup-ups for the FMU layer.</p>
  <ol>
      <li><b>Add Data:</b> The forest processing facility point layer and the forest management unit (FMU) polygon layer containing the Ontario 
        wood report data were added to the map. To facilitate rendering, the point layer was stacked on top of the polygon layer.</li>
      <li><b>Select Base Map:</b> A simple light-gray base map was chosen to add spatial context to the map without distracting from the focus of the 
        application.</li>
      <li><b>Set Symbology:</b> The FMU layer was displayed as a solid outline to show the bounds of the management unit. Each processing facility was displayed
         with a unique colour based on the facility type, and then further categorised by shape to help users differentiate between the sites. </li>
      <li><b>Edit Fields:</b> Many of the field names associated with the data layers were coded, so the field names for both layers were edited into 
        user-friendly titles so that the information can be easily interpreted.</li>
      <li><b>Configure Pop-Ups:</b> Fields to be included in the pop-up windows for both layers were selected based on what information was relevant 
        to the end-user. For the facility layer we chose to include information such as the facility type, owner, identification, location, and 
        operating status. For the FMU layer, we chose to include management information such as the FMU name, area, and licence holder, and 
        information on the available wood resources for the area. For the FMU pop-ups, we also included a pie chart to display the total merchantable 
        and unmerchantable timber resources in each FMU and text boxes to further explain the information displayed.</li>
  </ol>
</div>



<div class="containerleft">
  <h1>Configuring Experience Builder</h1>
  <img class="left" src="images\EB_widgets.jpg" alt="Configured Widgets">
  <ol>
  <li><b>Select a Template:</b> We chose to use the ESRI "Launchpad" template which has an emphasis on the map and a controller widget anchored at the 
    bottom of the page to get us started with building our application, however we turned off the “lock layout” option so we could further customize 
    the experience.</li>
  <li><b>Configure Map:</b> The web map displaying the forest resource layers rendered in the previous task was added to the experience as the main map layer 
    and the default view was adjusted.</li>
  <li><b>Update Branding:</b> To maintain consistency with our team's branding schema, the default colours and text were updated & an image widget containing 
    our logo was added.</li>
  <li><b>Configure Widgets:</b> We chose to add five widgets to the controller widget at the bottom of the screen to add interactivity to our experience. The 
    following widgets were configured:</li>
    <ul class="basic">
      <li><b>Map Layers:</b> The map layers widget is connected to the map and allows the user to turn on and off the FMU polygon layer and the forest processing 
        facility point layer.</li>
      <li><b>Legend:</b> The legend widget displays the symbology for the two forest resource layers on the map.</li>
      <li><b>Table:</b> The contact information table displays the contact information for each FMU. This table has a search function which allows the user to 
        search for information using either the FMU name or contact name.</li>
      <li><b>Filter:</b> The filter widget is connected to the forest processing facility point layer and allows the user to display only the selected facility 
        types on the map.</li>
      <li><b>Bookmark:</b> The bookmark widget was configured to display the four main regions of Ontario. The map zooms to the pre-set area when the user selects 
        a region from the bookmark.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <h1>Showcasing the Final Solution</h1>
  <h3>In order to preserve our final solution, here's a short GIF of one of our team members going through some of the different widgets:</h3>
  <img class="responsive5" src="images\Group Solution - Google Chrome 2021-04-20 17-38-14.gif" alt="Final Solution GIF">
  <h3>Our final product is an interactive web app that displays Ontario forest resource managment information with pop ups for the relevent 
    attribute data. The app is meant to be an informational tool for those working in, investing in, and managing the Ontario forest industry. 
    Available production facility data, forest management units, and the Available Wood Report from Ontario Geohub were all succesfully integrated.</h3>
  <img class="responsive5" src="images\FinalSolution_MainPage.JPG" alt="Main Page">
  <h3>The image above is what the user sees when they first open the platform. Simple and easy to use, to not overwhelm the user when they first 
    open it. Note the widgets in the lower left side.</h3>
  <img class="responsive5" src="images\FinalSolution_Contact.JPG" alt="Forest Manager Contact">
  <h3>With experience builder we were able to include simple tables. The image above shows contact information of the managers for each FMU. This could
     have been improved by joining the table to the FMU polygon layer in the data processing phase.</h3>
  <img class="responsive5" src="images\FinalSolution_Filter.JPG" alt="Filter Processing Facilities">
  <h3>One handy feature of experience builder is that you can add in filter widgets, as seen above. The user can specify a facility type depending on 
    their needs, and the map will only display that selection.</h3>
  <img class="responsive5" src="images\FinalSolution_RegionalBookmark.JPG" alt="Regional Forest Bookmarks">
  <h3>Users can also toggle through Regional Bookmarks - Consisting of Northwestern, Northeastern, Central, and Southern Ontario.</h3>
