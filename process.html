<h1 class="highlight">Development Process</h1>

<h3>
  Successfully arriving at a desired destination takes proper planning, communication, and execution of a well laid out plan. 
  Prior to any forward progress, a clear vision of the path to tread needs to be formed. As a group, we set out to map and create our vision. 
  The journey to our destination is outlined below.

  <h1>Deciding on a Topic</h1>
  <img class="left" src="images\FlemingandCRIBE.jfif" alt="Topic">
  <p>Our assignment to build an application using technologies of our choice presented the perfect opportunity to lay the groundwork and gain experience for the future design and completion of our collaborative project. Based on the needs previously established with the Centre for Research and Innovation into the Bio-Economy (CRIBE), our team decided to refine the scope of the collaborative project down to a manageable size. The refining process took a few attempts as we considered the different useful forestry applications such as, routing, least cost path analysis, facility locations, biomass availability and Ontario forest management unit (fmu) boundaries. In the end, our group decided to focus on creating a forestry infographic designed to present the end user with beneficial information about forestry facility locations found throughout Ontario accompanied by the Ontario fmu boundaries and its corresponding biomass information.</p>

  <h1>Deciding on a Platform</h1>
    <img class="right" src="images\platform.png" alt="platform" style="width:265px;height:345px;">
    <p>Our group predetermined that CRIBE uses the ESRI suite of products to run their geographic website components. The choice between which platform to pick was quickly narrowed down to Dashboards, AppBuilder and Experience Builder. At first our group considered using Dashboards because CRIBE currently uses this application on their website. It is well suited for displaying location-based statistics on a dashboard style layout. Dashboards was quickly weeded out we didn’t intend to incorporate statistics into our application. AppBuilder became our next focus. It boasts 70 plus widgets that provided us with a wide array of functionality to choose from whereas Experience Builder had only 18 to pick from. Our concern with AppBuilder was it is older technology and only provided a mapcentric, fixed screen option. Our group then turned to Experience Builder to compare the two applications. Experience Builder is new and provides options like a scrolling screen, single or multiple page options and is built of ArcGIS API 4.x for Javascript. After considering the pros and cons of each, we decided to move forward with Experience Builder based on the fact it is newer technology. </p>

  <h1>Finding and Processing the Data</h1>
  <img class="left" src="images\FindingData_Excel.png" alt="Finding Available Wood Report">
  <p>After deciding on Experience Builder as our platform, we had to find and process the Data using 
    ArcPro. Ontario GeoHub and Data Catalogue had the data we needed, consisting of:</p>
    <ul class="basic">
      <li><a href="https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/forest-management-unit?geometry=-151.490%2C38.917%2C-17.984%2C58.786" target="_blank">Forest Management Units (Shapefile)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/available-wood-report" target="_blank">Ontario Wood Report (Excel file)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/forest-processing-facility?geometry=-151.490%2C38.917%2C-17.984%2C58.786"target="_blank">Forest Processing Facilities (Shapefile)</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Building a Web Map</h1>
  <img class="right" src="images\CL_MapViewerBeta_Popup.png" alt="Screenshot of Map Viewer Beta">
  <p>The map displayed in the final solution was configured using AGOL Map Viewer (beta). The following steps were followed to 
    cartographically render the forest resources information.</p>
  <p>The screen capture on the right depicts the Map Viewer Beta environment and the configuration of pup-ups for the FMU layer.</p>
  <ol>
      <li><b>Add Data:</b> The forest processing facility point layer and the forest management unit (FMU) polygon layer containing the Ontario 
        wood report data were added to the map. To facilitate rendering, the point layer was stacked on top of the polygon layer.</li>
      <li><b>Select Base Map:</b> A simple light-gray base map was chosen to add spatial context to the map without distracting from the focus of the 
        application.</li>
      <li><b>Set Symbology:</b> The FMU layer was displayed as a solid outline to show the bounds of the management unit. Each processing facility was displayed
         with a unique colour based on the facility type, and then further categorised by shape to help users differentiate between the sites. </li>
      <li><b>Edit Fields:</b> Many of the field names associated with the data layers were coded, so the field names for both layers were edited into 
        user-friendly titles so that they can be easily interpreted.</li>
      <li><b>Configure Pop-Ups:</b> Fields to be included in the pop-up windows for both layers were selected based on what information was relevant 
        to the end-user. For the facility layer we chose to include information such as the facility type, owner, identification, location, and 
        operating status. For the FMU layer, we chose to include management information such as the FMU name, area, and licence holder, and 
        information on the available wood resources for the area. For the FMU pop-ups, we also included a pie chart to display the total merchantable 
        and unmerchantable timber resources and text boxes to further explain the information displayed.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Configuring Experience Builder</h1>
  <img class="left" src="images\EB_widgets.jpg" alt="Configured Widgets">
  <p>1) Select a Template: We chose to use the Launchpad ESRI template which has an emphasis on the map and a controller widget anchored at the 
    bottom of the page to get us started with building our application, however we turned off the “lock layout” option so we could further customize 
    the experience.</p>
  <p>2) Configure Map: The web map displaying the forest resource layers rendered in the previous task was added to the experience as the main map layer 
    and the default view was adjusted.</p>
  <p>3) Update Branding: To maintain consistency with our teams branding schema, the default colours and text were updated & an image widget containing 
    our logo was added.</p>
  <p>4) Configure Widgets: We chose to add five widgets to the controller widget at the bottom of the screen to add interactivity to our experience. The 
    following widgets were configured.</p>
  <p>a) Map Layers: The map layers widget is connected to the map and allows the user to turn on and off the FMU polygon layer and the forest processing 
    facility point layer.</p>
  <p>b) Legend: The legend widget displays the symbology for the two forest resource layers on the map.</p>
  <p>c) Table: The contact information table displays the contact information for each FMU. This table has a search function which allows the user to 
    search for information using either the FMU name or contact name.</p>
  <p>d) Filter: The filter widget is connected to the forest processing facility point layer and allows the user to display only the selected facility 
    types on the map.</p>
  <p>e) Bookmark: The bookmark widget was configured to display the four main regions of Ontario. The map zooms to the pre-set area when the user selects 
    a region from the bookmark.</p>
  <p>The screen capture on the left depicts the widgets within the final solution.</p>
