<h1 class="highlight">ISSUES AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES</h1> 

<h3>A significant portion of this project involved exploring the AGOL Experience Builder environment and determining a 
  way to best showcase information on Ontario’s forest resources. Several issues and technical challenges were discovered 
  as part of this exploratory process including the importance of data preprocessing, issues working collaboratively on one web solution, 
  and configuration of widgets. </h3>

    <h2>Finding and Processing Data</h2>
    <img src="images/Shortest-Route-Network-Analysis.png" alt="route" class="responsive5"> 
    <p> When we first set out to start our project, finding relevant data to convey the information
      we were trying to display proved challenging. We ended up finding the data we needed, but in 3 seperate files - 
      2 of which needed to be merged (the wood report text file and the FMU shapefile). However, after the join was 
      completed there were more than a few records of missing data for the forests, and some of the forests didnt have 
      any information on the available wood. So additional research was needed to fill in the blanks.</p>
      <p>***MAYBE-Add in this section the importance of pre-joining layers that you want connected for functionality in the experience builder. </p>
      <p>Example: To make the contact information table in the final solution have the “Action” functionality of zooming to 
        the corresponding FMU on the map when the contact for the FMU is selected in the table widget, the data must be within 
        the same layer. The contact info table and the FMU layer must be joined through a common field before the data is integrated into 
        Experience Builder. Experience builder does not have functionality to complete this join. If we were to complete this project again, 
        we would complete this join in ArcGIS Pro to allow for added functionality with the table widget.</p>

    <h2>Collaborative Functionality</h2>
    <img src="images\issue2_collaboration.jpg" alt="Collaboration Functionality" class="responsive5"> 
    <p>Out next technical challenge was to figure out a way to all effectively work on configuring one web application. 
      Initially, one team member created the experience builder and associated web map in their own account and shared it to our AGOL group, 
      ensuring the Experience Builder was set to published. This allowed others in our group to view the experience, however we ran into an 
      access warning which did not allow editing of the app by the other team members. </p>
      <p>Creating a copy of the app was an accessible option, so our work-around solution was to create a copy of the most current version, 
        and ensure we communicated which working version was the newest and what updates were applied.</p>
      <p>With the recent update of AGOL the editing abilities appear to have also changed. We are no longer experiencing access limitations, 
        and all members can edit the same published and shared experience builder app. This has increased our efficiency and ability to collaborate 
        to finalize the solution. Communication between contributors is still key, as editing the same features at the same time can cause 
        conflicts.</p>

  <div class="column1">
    <h2>Configuring Widget Pop-Ups</h2>
    <img src="images\issue3_widgetpopup.jpg" alt="Issue - Widget pop-ups cut off" class="responsive5"> 
    <p>There are several widgets available within Experience Builder that could be used to display Ontario orest resource information. 
      The functionality of some of the widgets were not apparently obvious, and many did not perform the tasks we initially intended 
      them to. Determining the best widgets to use in the app took a lot of experimentation and reading relevant documentation.</p>
    <p>We found that some widget functionality is not fully configurable. For example, when a user selects one of the widgets within the controller panel 
      at the bottom of the screen, such as the table widget, a pop-up window appears but it may not be sized correctly so some of the information is cut off.
      While the user can stretch the size of the window to display the rest of the information, as developers it would be nice to be able to pre-set this 
      feature. Unfortunately, we did not find a solution to be able to alter the default pop-up window size.</p>
